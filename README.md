# LLM-based Small Projects

This repository contains small projects and experiments based on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, focusing on practical use cases, prototyping, and learning.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.13** (Python 3.10+ should also work unless otherwise specified)
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- (Optional but recommended) `virtualenv`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3.13 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Projects

Run the main script or individual project files:

```bash
python main.py
```

(Adjust the filename depending on the project you want to run.)

## Project Structure

```
```

## Notes

- Ensure `requirements.txt` is kept up to date when adding new dependencies.
- If Python 3.13 is not available on your system, Python **3.10+** is recommended for compatibility with most LLM libraries.
- API keys (if required) should be stored securely using environment variables and **never committed** to the repository.
